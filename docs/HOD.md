HOD denotes the class of *Hereditarily Ordinal Definable* sets. It is a
definable canonical inner
[model](Model "Model") of
[ZFC](ZFC "ZFC").

  
Although it is definable, this definition is not absolute for transitive
inner models of ZF, i.e. given two models $M$ and $N$ of $ZF$, $HOD$ as
computed in $M$ may differ from $HOD$ as computed in $N$.

## Ordinal Definable Sets

Elements of $OD$ are all definable from a finite collection of ordinals.

## Relativizations

## gHOD

Generic HOD (gHOD) is the intersection of HODs of all
set-[generic](Forcing "Forcing")
extensions of
$V$. {% cite Fuchs2015 %}
