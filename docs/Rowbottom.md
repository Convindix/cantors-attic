Rowbottom cardinals were discovered by Frederick Rowbottom in 1971 as a strong [large cardinal axiom](Upper_attic "Upper attic") which implies the existence and consistency of [$0^{\\#}$](Zero_sharp "Zero sharp"). In terms of consistency strength, [ZFC](ZFC "ZFC") + Rowbottom is equiconsistent to ZFC + [Jónsson](Jonsson "Jonsson"), ZFC + Rowbottom is equiconsistent to ZFC + [Ramsey](Ramsey "Ramsey"), and ZFC + Rowbottom is stronger than ZFC + $0^{\\#}$. Every Rowbottom cardinal is Jónsson, and every Ramsey cardinal is Rowbottom. {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
## Definition

Rowbottom cardinals are defined with a [partition property](Partition_property "Partition property"):
-   $\\kappa$ is *$\\nu$-Rowbottom* iff $\\kappa\\rightarrow [\\kappa]^{<\\omega}\_{\\lambda,<\\nu}$ for every $\\lambda<\\kappa$. This means that for any partition (function) $f:[\\kappa]^{<\\omega}\\rightarrow\\lambda$, there is some set of ordinals $H\\subseteq\\kappa$ such that $(H,<)$ has order type $\\kappa$ and $|f^{\\prime\\,\\prime}[H]^{<\\omega}|<\\nu$.
-   $\\kappa$ is *Rowbottom* iff it is $\\omega\_1$-Rowbottom.

Equivalently, $\\kappa$ is Rowbottom if and only if $\\kappa>\\aleph\_1$ and $\\kappa$ satisfies a strong generalization of [Chang's conjecture](Chang's_conjecture "Chang's conjecture"), namely, any model of type $(\\kappa,\\lambda)$ for some uncountable $\\lambda<\\kappa$ has a proper elementary substructure of type $(\\kappa,\\aleph\_0)$. {% cite Jech2003 %}

Rowbottom cardinals are not necessarily "large". In fact, the [Axiom of Determinacy](Axiom_of_Determinacy "Axiom of Determinacy") implies $\\aleph\_\\omega$ is Rowbottom, and it is widely considered consistent for $\\aleph\_\\omega$ to be Rowbottom even under the [Axiom of Choice](Axiom_of_Choice "Axiom of Choice"). If it is consistent for $\\aleph\_\\omega$ to be Rowbottom, it is consistent for $\\aleph\_{\\omega^2}$ to be the least Rowbottom cardinal. {% cite Kanamori2009 %}

## Facts

-   Every Rowbottom cardinal $\\kappa$ either has cofinality $\\omega$ or is weakly inaccessible. {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   Every $\\nu$-Rowbottom cardinal either has cofinality less than $\\nu$ or is [weakly inaccessible](Inaccessible "Inaccessible") (and thus if a $\\nu$-Rowbottom cardinal $\\kappa$ has cofinality $\\nu$, then $\\nu=\\kappa$ and $\\kappa$ is $\\kappa$-Rowbottom.) {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   Any singular limit $\\kappa$ of [measurable](Measurable "Measurable") cardinals is $\\mathrm{cf}(\\kappa)^+$-Rowbottom. {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   If $\\kappa$ is $\\nu$-Rowbottom and there is a limit cardinal $\\lambda$ such that $\\nu\\leq\\lambda<\\kappa$, then $\\kappa$ is a limit of limit cardinals (i.e. $\\aleph\_{\\alpha^\\beta}$ for some ordinals $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$). {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
### Consistency strength
-   If a Rowbottom exists, then [$0^{\\#}$](Zero_sharp "Zero sharp") exists and is consistent. {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   Every Rowbottom cardinal is Jónsson. {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   If $\\kappa=2^{<\\nu}$ is a regular $\\nu$-Rowbottom cardinal, then for any $\\nu\\leq\\lambda<\\kappa$, $2^\\lambda=\\kappa$. Thus, if the first condition holds for $\\kappa$ and $\\nu$ but $\\nu < \\kappa$, then [GCH](GCH "GCH") fails at every cardinal $\\lambda\\in[\\nu,\\kappa)$. {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   For any $0< n<\\omega$, the theories $\\textrm{ZF+DC}\_{\\aleph\_n}+\\aleph\_\\omega\\textrm{ is Rowbottom and carries a Rowbottom filter}$ and $\\textrm{ZFC+A measurable exists}$ are equiconsistent.
