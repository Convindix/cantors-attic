Rowbottom cardinals were discovered by Frederick Rowbottom in 1971 as a
strong [large cardinal
axiom](Upper_attic "Upper attic")
which implies the existence and consistency of
<a href="Zero_sharp" class="mw-redirect" title="Zero sharp">$0^{\#}$</a>.
In terms of consistency strength,
[ZFC](ZFC "ZFC") +
Rowbottom is equiconsistent to ZFC +
[Jónsson](Jonsson "Jonsson"),
ZFC + Rowbottom is equiconsistent to ZFC +
[Ramsey](Ramsey "Ramsey"),
and ZFC + Rowbottom is stronger than ZFC + $0^{\\\#}$. Every Rowbottom
cardinal is Jónsson, and every Ramsey cardinal is Rowbottom.

## Definition

Rowbottom cardinals are defined with a [partition
property](Partition_property "Partition property"):

-   $κ$ is *$\\nu$-Rowbottom* iff $κ\\rightarrow
    \[κ\]^{&lt;ω}\_{λ,&lt;\\nu}$ for every
    $λ&lt;κ$. This means that for any partition (function)
    $f:\[κ\]^{&lt;ω}\\rightarrowλ$, there is some set
    of ordinals $H\\subseteqκ$ such that $(H,&lt;)$ has order type
    $κ$ and $\|f"\[H\]^{&lt;ω}\|&lt;\\nu$.
-   $κ$ is *Rowbottom* iff it is $ω\_1$-Rowbottom.

Equivalently, $κ$ is Rowbottom if and only if
$κ&gt;\\aleph\_1$ and $κ$ satisfies a strong generalization
of [Chang's
conjecture](Chang%27s_conjecture "Chang's conjecture"),
namely, any model of type $(κ,λ)$ for some uncountable
$λ&lt;κ$ has a proper elementary substructure of type
$(κ,\\aleph\_0)$. {% cite Jech2003 %}

Rowbottom cardinals are not necessarily "large". In fact, the
<a href="Axiom_of_Determinacy" class="mw-redirect" title="Axiom of Determinacy">Axiom of Determinacy</a>
implies $\\aleph\_ω$ is Rowbottom, and it is widely considered
consistent for $\\aleph\_ω$ to be Rowbottom even under the
<a href="Axiom_of_Choice" class="mw-redirect" title="Axiom of Choice">Axiom of Choice</a>.
If it is consistent for $\\aleph\_ω$ to be Rowbottom, it is
consistent for $\\aleph\_{ω^2}$ to be the least Rowbottom
cardinal. {% cite Kanamori2009 %}

## Facts

-   If a Rowbottom exists, then
    <a href="Zero_sharp" class="mw-redirect" title="Zero sharp">$0^{\#}$</a>
    exists and is consistent.

-   Every Rowbottom cardinal is Jónsson.
    {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   Every Rowbottom cardinal $κ$ either has cofinality $ω$
    or is weakly inaccessible.
    {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   Every $\\nu$-Rowbottom cardinal either has cofinality less than
    $\\nu$ or is [weakly
    inaccessible](Inaccessible "Inaccessible")
    (and thus if a $\\nu$-Rowbottom cardinal $κ$ has cofinality
    $\\nu$, then $\\nu=κ$ and $κ$ is $κ$-Rowbottom.)
    {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   Any singular limit $κ$ of
    [measurable](Measurable "Measurable")
    cardinals is $\\mathrm{cf}(κ)^+$-Rowbottom.
    {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   If $κ=2^{&lt;\\nu}$ is a regular $\\nu$-Rowbottom cardinal,
    then for any $\\nu\\leqλ&lt;κ$, $2^λ=κ$.
    Thus, if the first condition holds for $κ$ and $\\nu$ but
    $\\nu &lt; κ$, then
    <a href="GCH" class="mw-redirect" title="GCH">GCH</a>
    fails at every cardinal $λ\\in\[\\nu,κ)$.
    {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
-   If $κ$ is $\\nu$-Rowbottom and there is a limit cardinal
    $λ$ such that $\\nu\\leqλ&lt;κ$, then $κ$
    is a limit of limit cardinals (i.e. $\\aleph\_{α^β}$ for
    some ordinals $α$ and $β$).
