Welcome to the middle attic, where the uncountable cardinals, that solid stock of mathematics, begin their endless upward structural progession. Here, we survey the infinite cardinals whose existence can be proved in, or is at least equiconsistent with, the ZFC axioms of set theory.

-    into the [upper attic](Upper_attic "Upper attic")
-    [correct](Correct "Correct") cardinals, [ $V\_\\delta\\prec V$](Reflecting_cardinals "Reflecting cardinals") and the [Feferman theory](Reflecting_cardinals#Feferman_theory "Reflecting cardinals#Feferman theory")
-    [$\\Sigma\_2$ correct](Reflecting\_cardinals#.24.5CSigma\_2.24-correct\_cardinals "Reflecting\_cardinals#.24.5CSigma\_2.24-correct\_cardinals") and [$\\Sigma\_n$-correct](Correct "Correct") cardinals

-    [$\\Sigma\_n$-extendible](Extendible#Sigma\_n-extendible_cardinals "Extendible#Sigma\_n-extendible cardinals") cardinal
-    [ $\\beth$-fixed point](Beth#beth\_fixed\_point_ "Beth#beth\_fixed\_point ")
-    the [beth](Beth "Beth") numbers and the [ $\\beth\_\\alpha$ hierarchy](Beth_ "Beth ")
-    [ $\\beth\_\\omega$](Beth_omega_ "Beth omega ") and the [strong limit](Strong_limit "Strong limit") cardinals

-    [ $\\aleph\_\\omega$](Aleph#aleph_omega_ "Aleph#aleph omega ") and [singular](Singular "Singular") cardinals
-    [ $\\aleph\_2$](Aleph#aleph_two_ "Aleph#aleph two "), the second uncountable cardinal
-    [uncountable](Uncountable "Uncountable"), [regular](Regular "Regular") and [successor](Successor "Successor") cardinals
