The *Church-Kleene* ordinal $\\omega\_1^{ck}$ is the supremum of the computable ordinals, where an ordinal $\\alpha$ is *computable* if there is a computable relation $\\lhd$ on $\\mathbb{N}$ of order type $\\alpha$, that is, such that $\\langle\\alpha,\\lt\\rangle\\cong\\langle\\mathbb{N},\\lhd\\rangle$.

This ordinal is closed under all of the elementary ordinal arithmetic operations, such as successor, addition, multiplication and exponentiation.

Depending on conventions, there are two possibilities for where <math>\\omega\_1^{ck}</math> appears on the hierarchy of admissible ordinals:
-   The Church-Kleene ordinal is the least [admissible](Admissible "Admissible") ordinal. This is when [Kripke-Platek set theory](Kripke-Platek "Kripke-Platek") is considered to include the axiom of infinity, so <math>L\_\\omega\\not\\vDash\\textrm{KP}</math>.
-   <math>\\omega</math> and <math>\\omega\_1^{ck}</math> are the two smallest admissible ordinals. This is when [Kripke-Platek set theory](Kripke-Platek "Kripke-Platek") is not considered to include the axiom of infinity, so <math>L\_\\omega\\vDash\\textrm{KP}</math>.

## Relativized Church-Kleene ordinal

The Church-Kleene idea easily relativizes to oracles, where for any real $x$, we define $\\omega\_1^x$ to be the supremum of the $x$-computable ordinals.  This is also the least [admissible](Admissible "Admissible") ordinal relative to $x$, and every countable successor admissible ordinal is $\\omega\_1^x$ for some $x$. Note that here, <math>\\omega\_1^x</math> doesn't denote the set defined by a relativized definition of <math>\\omega\_1</math>, like what <math>\\omega\_1^L</math> often denotes.

Friedman, Jensen, and Sacks proved that any countable admissible ordinal is of the form <math>\\omega\_1^x</math> for some real <math>x</math>. ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81133582.pdf#page=25 source])
