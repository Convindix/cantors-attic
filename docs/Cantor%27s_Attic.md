Climb into Cantor's Attic, where you will find infinities large and small. We aim to provide a comprehensive resource of information about all notions of mathematical infinity. Our site is organized into several large categories:

:; [ The upper attic](Upper_attic_ "Upper attic ") : The upper attic is the realm of large cardinals and the higher infinite, extending from inaccessibility to inconsistency.
:; [ The middle attic](Middle_attic_ "Middle attic ") : The middle attic surveys the infinite cardinals whose existence can be proved in, or is at least equiconsistent with, the ZFC axioms of set theory.
:; [ The lower attic](Lower_attic_ "Lower attic ") : The lower attic classifies various large countable ordinals.

:; [ The parlour](Parlour_ "Parlour ") : Aspiring to the attic, the parlour contains the truly vast finite numbers.

:; [ The playroom](Playroom_ "Playroom ") : Enjoy the stimulating entertainments of the playroom, full of fun and paradox.
:; [ The library](Library_ "Library ") : Peruse the selections of our library, the central repository of all references cited here at Cantor's attic.
:; [ The cellar](Cellar_ "Cellar ") : Review the foundations of our subject with informative background presentations of ideas used throughout the attic.
