*Hypercompactness* is a large cardinal property that is a strengthening
of
[supercompactness](Supercompact "Supercompact").
A cardinal $κ$ is *$α$-hypercompact* if and only if for
every ordinal $β &lt; α$ and for every cardinal
$λ\\geqκ$, there exists a cardinal $λ'\\geqλ$
and an elementary embedding $j:V\\to M$ generated by a [normal fine
ultrafilter](Filter "Filter")
on $P\_κλ$ such that $κ$ is $β$-hypercompact in
$M$. $κ$ is *hypercompact* if and only if it is
$β$-hypercompact for every ordinal $β$.

Every cardinal is 0-hypercompact, and 1-hypercompactness is equivalent
to supercompactness.
