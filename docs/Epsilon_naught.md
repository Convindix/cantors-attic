The ordinal $\\epsilon\_0$, commonly given the British pronunciation
"epsilon naught," is the smallest ordinal $α$ for which
$α=ω^α$ and can be equivalently characterized as the
supremum

$$\\epsilon\_0=\\sup\\{ω,ω^ω,ω^{ω^ω},\\ldots\\}$$

The [ordinals below
$\\epsilon\_0$](Small_countable_ordinals "Small countable ordinals")
exhibit an attractive finitistic normal form of representation, arising
from an iterated Cantor normal form involving only finite numbers and
the expression $ω$ in finitely iterated exponentials, products and
sums.

The ordinal $\\epsilon\_0$ arises in diverse proof-theoretic contexts.
For example, it is the proof-theoretic ordinal of the first-order Peano
axioms.

## Epsilon numbers

The ordinal $\\epsilon\_0$ is the first ordinal in the hierarchy of
$\\epsilon$-numbers, where $\\epsilon\_α$ is the $α^{\\rm
th}$ fixed point of the exponential function
$β\\mapstoω^β$. These can also be defined inductively,
as
$\\epsilon\_{α+1}=\\sup\\{\\epsilon\_α+1,ω^{\\epsilon\_α+1},ω^{ω^{\\epsilon\_α+1}},\\ldots\\}$,
and $\\epsilon\_λ=\\sup\_{α\\ltλ}\\epsilon\_α$
for limit ordinals $λ$. The epsilon numbers therefore form an
increasing continuous sequence of ordinals. Every uncountable infinite
cardinal $κ$ is an epsilon number fixed point
$κ=\\epsilon\_κ$.
