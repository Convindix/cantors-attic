Kripke-Platek set theory ($\\text{KP}$) is a collection of axioms that is considerably weaker than [ZFC](ZFC "ZFC"). The formal language used to express each axiom is first-order with equality ($=$) together with one binary relation symbol, $\\in$, intended to denote set membership.

$L\_\\alpha$ is a model of $\\mathrm{KP}$ for [admissible](Admissible "Admissible") $\\alpha$.

## Axiom of Extensionality
Sets are determined uniquely by their elements. This is expressed formally as $$ \\forall x \\forall y \\big(\\forall z (z\\in x\\leftrightarrow z\\in y)\\rightarrow x=y\\big).$$

The &ldquo;$\\rightarrow$&rdquo; can be replaced by &ldquo;$\\leftrightarrow$&rdquo;, but the $\\leftarrow$ direction is a theorem of logic.

## Axiom of Null Set
There exists some set. In fact, there is a set which contains no members.
This is expressed formally $$ \\exists x \\forall y (y\\not\\in x).$$

Such an $x$ is unique by extensionality and this set is denoted by $\\emptyset$.

## Axiom of Pairing
For any two sets $x$ and $y$ (not necessarily distinct) there is a further set $z$ whose members are exactly the sets $x$ and $y$.
 
$$ \\forall x \\forall y \\exists  z \\forall w \\big(w\\in z\\leftrightarrow (w=x\\vee w=y)\\big).$$

Such a $z$ is unique by extensionality and is denoted as $\\{x,y\\}$.

## Axiom of Union
For any set $x$ there is a further set $y$ whose members are exactly all the members of the members of $x$. That is, the union of all the members of a set exists. This is expressed formally as

$$\\forall x \\exists y \\forall z \\big(z\\in y \\leftrightarrow \\exists w (w\\in x \\wedge z\\in w)\\big).$$

Such a $y$ is unique by extensionality and is written as $y = \\bigcup x$.

## Axiom Schema of Foundation
Suppose that a given property $P$ is true for some set $x$. Then there is a $\\in$-minimal set for which $P$ is true.
In more detail, given a formula $\\varphi(x\_1,\\dots,x\_n,x)$ the following is an instance of the induction schema:
$$\\forall x\_1, \\ldots, x\_n \\big[ \\exists x \\varphi(x\_1, \\ldots, x\_n, x) \\rightarrow \\exists y \\big( \\varphi(x\_1, \\ldots, x\_n, y) \\wedge \\forall z \\in y \\neg \\varphi(x\_1, \\ldots, x\_n, z) \\big) \\big]$$

Some authors replace this with the axiom of regularity. (example: [Gostanian, "The Next Admissible Ordinal", 1979](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82692209.pdf#page=4))

## Axiom Schema of $\\Sigma\_0$-Separation
For any set $a$ and any $\\Sigma\_0$-predicate $P(x)$ written in the language of ZFC, the set $\\{x\\in a: P(x)\\}$ exists. In more detail, given any $\\Sigma\_0$-formula $\\varphi$ with free variables $x\_1,x\_2,\\dots,x\_n$ the following is an instance of the $\\Sigma\_0$-seperation schema:
$$ \\forall a \\forall x\_1 \\forall x\_2\\dots \\forall x\_n \\exists y \\forall z \\big(z\\in y \\leftrightarrow (z\\in a \\wedge \\varphi(x\_1,x\_2,\\dots,x\_n,z)\\big) $$

Such a $y$, unique by extensionality and is written (for fixed sets $a, x\_1\\dots, x\_n$) $y=\\{z\\in a: \\varphi(x\_1,x\_2,\\dots,x\_n,z)\\}$.

## Axiom Schema of $\\Sigma\_0$-Collection
If $a$ is a set and for all $x\\in a$ there's a some $y$ such that $(x,y)$ satisfies a given $\\Sigma\_0$-property, then there is some set $b$ such that all such $y$ are contained in $b$. In more detail, given a $\\Sigma\_0$-formula $\\varphi(x\_1,\\dots,x\_n,x,y)$ the following is an instance of the $\\Sigma\_0$-collection schema:
$$ \\forall a \\forall x\_1 \\dots \\forall x\_n \\big[\\big( \\forall x\\in a \\exists y \\varphi(x\_1,\\dots,x\_n,x,y)\\big)\\rightarrow \\big(\\exists b \\forall x \\in a \\exists y \\in b \\varphi(x\_1, \\ldots, x\_n, x,y) \\big) \\big].$$

## Axiom of Infinity
Some authors<!--Such as Christoph Duchhardt--> include the axiom of infinity in Kripke-Platek set theory which states that there is <!--What Jech calls-->an [inductive set](Inductive_set "Inductive set") â€“ a canonical example of an infinite set. More precisely:
$$ \\exists x \\big( \\emptyset \\in x \\wedge \\forall y \\in x (y \\cup \\{y \\} \\in x) \\big).$$
The axiom of infinity combined with an instance of $\\Sigma\_0$-separation imply the axiom of null set so that it be dropped if one assumes the axiom of infinity.
