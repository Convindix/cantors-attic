An ordinal is called **bad** if the supremum of order types of $\\alpha$-recursive well-orderings is less than the next [admissible](Admissible "Admissible") after $\\alpha$. Since the least bad ordinal is quite large (larger than the least $\\Pi\_1^1$-[reflecting ordinal](Reflecting_ordinal "Reflecting ordinal") [https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82692209.pdf#page=32]), this behavior appears unexpectedly when working with ordinals in the range of weakened versions of [stability](Stable "Stable").

## Relation to other conditions
-   $\\Sigma\_1^1$-[reflection](Reflecting_ordinal "Reflecting ordinal") implies badness [https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82692209.pdf#page=28]
