Chang's conjecture is a model theoretic assertion which implies many
structures of a certain variety have elementary substructures of another
variety. Chang's conjecture was originally formulated in 1963 by Chen
Chung Chang and Vaught.

Chang's conjecture is equiconsistent over $\\text{ZFC}$ to the existence
of the
[$ω\_1$-Erdős](Erdos "Erdos")
cardinal. In particular, if you collapse an $ω\_1$-Erdős cardinal
to $ω\_2$ with the Silver collapse, then in the resulting model
Chang's conjecture holds. On the other hand, if Chang's conjecture is
true, then $ω\_2$ is $ω\_1$-Erdős in a transitive inner
model of $\\text{ZFC}$.

Chang's conjecture implies $0^{\\\#}$ exists.

## Definition

The notation $(κ,λ)\\twoheadrightarrow(\\nu,\\mu)$ is the
assertion that every structure $\\mathfrak{A}=(A;R^A...)$ with a
countable language such that $\|A\|=κ$ and $\|R^A\|=λ$ has
a [proper elementary
substructure](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
$\\mathfrak{B}=(B;R^B...)$ with $\|B\|=\\nu$ and $\|R^B\|=\\mu$.

This notation is somewhat intertwined with the [square bracket partition
properties](Partition_property "Partition property").
Namely, letting $κ\\geqλ$ and
$κ\\geq\\mu\\geq\\nu&gt;ω$, the partition property
$κ\\rightarrow\[\\mu\]^{&lt;ω}\_{λ,&lt;\\nu}$ is
equivalent to the existence of some $\\rho&lt;\\nu$ such that
$(κ,λ)\\twoheadrightarrow(\\mu,\\rho)$.

As a result, some large cardinal axioms and partition properties can be
described with this notation. In particular:

-   $κ$ is
    [Rowbottom](Rowbottom "Rowbottom")
    if and only if $κ&gt;\\aleph\_1$ and for any uncountable
    $λ&lt;κ$,
    $(κ,λ)\\twoheadrightarrow(κ,\\aleph\_0)$.
    {% cite Jech2003 %}
-   $κ$ is
    [Jónsson](Jonsson "Jonsson")
    if and only if for any $λ\\leqκ$, there is some
    $\\nu\\leqκ$ such that
    $(κ,λ)\\twoheadrightarrow(κ,\\nu)$.
    {% cite Jech2003 %}

**Chang's conjecture** is precisely
$(\\aleph\_2,\\aleph\_1)\\twoheadrightarrow(\\aleph\_1,\\aleph\_0)$.
Chang's conjecture is equivalent to the [partition
property](Partition_property "Partition property")
$ω\_2\\rightarrow\[ω\_1\]\_{\\aleph\_1,&lt;\\aleph\_1}^{&lt;ω}$.

## Variants

There are many stronger variants of Chang's conjecture. Here are a few
and their upper bounds for consistency strength (all can be found in
{% cite Eskrew2016 %}):

-   Assuming the consistency of a $κ$ which is
    [$κ^{++}$-supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact"),
    it is consistent that there is a proper class of cardinals
    $λ$ such that
    $(λ^{+++},λ^{++})\\twoheadrightarrow(λ^+,λ)$.
-   Assuming the consistency of a $κ$ which is
    [$κ^{++}$-supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact"),
    it is consistent that there is a proper class of cardinals $κ$
    such that
    $(λ^{+ω+2},λ^{+ω+1})\\twoheadrightarrow(λ^+,λ)$.
-   Assuming the consistency of a cardinal $κ$ which is
    [$κ^{+ω+1}$-supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact"),
    it is consistent that
    $(\\aleph\_{ω+1},\\aleph\_ω)\\twoheadrightarrow(\\aleph\_1,\\aleph\_0)$.
-   Assuming the consistency of a
    [huge](Huge "Huge")
    cardinal, it is consistent that
    $(κ^{++},κ^+)\\twoheadrightarrow(\\mu^+,\\mu)$ for every
    $κ$ and $\\mu&lt;κ^+$.
-   It is unknown whether or not it is consistent that
    $(\\aleph\_{ω\_1+1},\\aleph\_{ω\_1})\\twoheadrightarrow(\\aleph\_{ω+1},\\aleph\_ω)$.
