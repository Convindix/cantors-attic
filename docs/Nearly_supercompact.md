title: Nearly $\theta$-supercompact cardinals
permalink: Nearly_supercompact

The near $\\theta$-supercompactness hierarchy of cardinals was
introduced by Jason Schanker in
{% cite Schanker2012 %} and
{% cite Schanker2011a %}. The hierarchy stratifies the
$\\theta$-supercompactness hierarchy in the sense that every
$\\theta$-supercompact cardinal is nearly $\\theta$-supercompact, and
every nearly $2^{\\theta^{ {&lt;}κ}}$-supercompact cardinal
$κ$ is $\\theta$-supercompact. However, these cardinals can be
very different. For example, relative to the existence of a supercompact
cardinal $κ$ with an inaccessible cardinal $\\theta$ above it, we
can force to destroy $κ$'s measurability while still retaining its
near $\\theta$-supercompactness and the
<a href="Weakly_inaccessible" class="mw-redirect" title="Weakly inaccessible">weak inaccessibility</a>
of $\\theta$. Yet, if $\\theta^{ {&lt;}κ} = \\theta$ and $κ$
is $\\theta$-supercompact, we can also force to preserve $κ$'s
$\\theta$-supercompactness while destroying any potential near
$\\theta^+$-supercompactness without collapsing cardinals below
$\\theta^{++}$. Assuming that $\\theta^{ {&lt;}κ} = \\theta$,
nearly $\\theta$-supercompact cardinals $κ$ exhibit a hybrid of
[weak
compactness](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact")
and
[supercompactness](Supercompact "Supercompact")
in that the witnessing
[embeddings](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
are between $\\text{ZFC}^-$ ($\\text{ZFC}$ minus the powerset axiom)
models of size $\\theta$ but are generated by "partially normal" fine
[filters](Filter "Filter")
on $\\mathcal{P}\_{κ}(\\theta$). [Weakly
compact](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact")
cardinals $κ$ are nearly $κ$-supercompact.

## Formal definition

A cardinal $κ$ is *nearly $\\theta$-supercompact* if and only if
for every $A\\subseteq\\theta$, there exists a transitive $M \\vDash
ZFC^{-}$ closed under ${&lt;}κ$ sequences with $A, κ,
\\theta \\in M$, a transitive $N$, and an [elementary
embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
$j: M \\rightarrow N$ with critical point $κ$ such that
$j(κ) &gt; \\theta$ and $j''\\theta \\in N$. A cardinal is *nearly
supercompact* if it is nearly $\\theta$-supercompact for all $\\theta$.

## Characterizations of near $\\theta$-supercompactness

If $\\theta^{ {&lt;}κ} = \\theta$, then the following are
equivalent characterizations for the near $\\theta$-supercompactness of
$κ$:

Embedding   
For every ${&lt;}κ$-closed transitive set $M$ of size $\\theta$
with $\\theta \\in M$, there exists a transitive $N$ and an elementary
embedding $j: M \\rightarrow N$ with critical point $κ$ such that
$j(κ) &gt; \\theta$ and $j''\\theta \\in N$.


Normal Embedding   


Normal ZFC Embedding   


Normal Fine Filter   
For every family of subsets $\\mathcal{A} \\subset
\\mathcal{P}\_κ(\\theta)$ of size at most $\\theta$ and every
collection $\\mathcal{F}$ of at most $\\theta$ many functions from
$\\mathcal{P}\_{κ}(\\theta)$ into $\\theta$, there exists a
$κ$-complete fine
[filter](Filter "Filter")
$F$ on $\\mathcal{P}\_{κ}(\\theta)$, which is
$\\mathcal{F}$-normal in the sense that for every $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$
that's regressive on some set in $F$, there exists $α\_f &lt;
\\theta$ for which $\\{\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{P}\_{κ}(\\theta)\|
f(\\sigma) = α\_f\\} \\in F$.
