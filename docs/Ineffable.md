Ineffable cardinals were introduced by Jensen and Kunen in
{% cite Jensen1969 %} and arose out of their study
of $\\diamondsuit$ principles. An uncountable regular cardinal $κ$
is ineffable if for every sequence $\\langle A\_α\\mid
α&lt;κ\\rangle$ with $A\_α\\subseteq α$ there is
$A\\subseteqκ$ such that the set $S=\\{α&lt;κ\\mid
A\\cap α=A\_α\\}$ is stationary. Equivalently an uncountable
regular $κ$ is ineffable if and only if for every function
$F:\[κ\]^2\\rightarrow 2$ there is a stationary
$H\\subseteqκ$ such that $F\\upharpoonright \[H\]^2$ is constant
{% cite Jensen1969 %}. This second characterization
strengthens a characterization of weakly compact cardinals which
requires that there exist such an $H$ of size $κ$.

If $κ$ is ineffable, then $\\diamondsuit\_κ$ holds and there
cannot be a slim $κ$-Kurepa tree
{% cite Jensen1969 %}. A $κ$-Kurepa tree is
a tree of height $κ$ having levels of size less than $κ$ and
at least $κ^+$-many branches. A $κ$-Kurepa tree is slim if
every infinite level $α$ has size at most $\|α\|$.

An uncountable cardinal κ has the
[normal filter property](Filter_property "Filter property")
iff it is
ineffable. {% cite Holy2018 %}


## Ineffable cardinals and the constructible universe

Ineffable cardinals are downward absolute to $L$. In $L$, an
inaccessible cardinal $κ$ is ineffable if and only if there are no
slim $κ$-Kurepa trees. Thus, for inaccessible cardinals, in $L$,
ineffability is completely characterized using slim Kurepa trees.

If [$0^\sharp$](Zero_sharp "Zero sharp")
exists, then every Silver indiscernible is ineffable in $L$.
{% cite Jech2003 %}

[Ramsey](Ramsey "Ramsey")
cardinals are stationary limits of completely ineffable cardinals, they
are weakly ineffable, but the least Ramsey cardinal is not ineffable.
Ineffable Ramsey cardinals are limits of Ramsey cardinals, because
ineffable cardinals are $Π^1\_2$-indescribable and being Ramsey is a
$Π^1\_2$-statement. The least strongly Ramsey cardinal also is not
ineffable, but super weakly Ramsey cardinals are ineffable. $1$-iterable
(=weakly Ramsey) cardinals are weakly ineffable and stationary limits of
completely ineffable cardinals. The least $1$-iterable cardinal is not
ineffable. {% cite Holy2018 Gitman2011 %}

## Weakly ineffable cardinal

Weakly ineffable cardinals (also called almost ineffable) were
introduced by Jensen and Kunen in
{% cite Jensen1969 %} as a weakening of ineffable
cardinals. An uncountable regular cardinal $κ$ is weakly ineffable
if for every sequence $\\langle A\_α\\mid
α&lt;κ\\rangle$ with $A\_α\\subseteq α$ there is
$A\\subseteqκ$ such that the set $S=\\{α&lt;κ\\mid
A\\cap α=A\_α\\}$ has size $κ$. If $κ$ is weakly
ineffable, then $\\diamondsuit\_κ$ holds.

-   Weakly ineffable cardinals are downward absolute to $L$.
    {% cite Jensen1969 %}
-   Weakly ineffable cardinals are
    $\\Pi\_1^1$-[indescribable](Indescribable "Indescribable").

-   Ineffable cardinals are limits of weakly ineffable cardinals.
-   Weakly ineffable cardinals are limits of
    [totally indescribable](Totally_indescribable "Totally indescribable")
    cardinals. {% cite Jensen1969 %}
    ({% cite Abramson1977 %} for proof)
-   For a cardinal $κ=κ^{&lt;κ}$, $κ$ is weakly ineffable iff it is
    genuine
    0-[Ramsey](Ramsey "Ramsey").
    {% cite Nielsen2018 %}

## Subtle cardinal

Subtle cardinals were introduced by Jensen and Kunen in
{% cite Jensen1969 %} as a weakening of weakly
ineffable cardinals. A uncountable regular cardinal $κ$ is subtle
if for every for every $\\langle A\_α\\mid
α&lt;κ\\rangle$ with $A\_α\\subseteq α$ and
every closed unbounded $C\\subseteqκ$ there are
$α&lt;β$ in $C$ such that $A\_β\\capα=A\_α$.
If $κ$ is subtle, then $\\diamondsuit\_κ$ holds.

-   Subtle cardinals are downward absolute to $L$.
    {% cite Jensen1969 %}
-   Weakly ineffable cardinals are limits of subtle cardinals.
    {% cite Jensen1969 %}
-   Subtle cardinals are stationary limits of
    [totally indescribable](Totally_indescribable "Totally indescribable")
    cardinals. {% cite Jensen1969 Friedman1998 %}
-   The least subtle cardinal is not weakly compact as it is
    $\\Pi\_1^1$-describable.
-   [$α$-Erdős](Erdos "Erdos")
    cardinals are subtle. {% cite Jensen1969 %}
-   If $δ$ is a subtle cardinal,
    -   the set of cardinals $κ$ below $δ$ that are [strongly
        uplifting](Uplifting "Uplifting")
        in $V\_δ$ is
        stationary. {% cite Hamkins2014a %}
    -   for every class $\\mathcal{A}$, in every club $B ⊆ δ$ there is
        $κ$ such that $\\langle V\_δ, \\mathcal{A} ∩ V\_δ \\rangle
        \\models \\text{“$κ$ is
        $\\mathcal{A}$-shrewd.”}$. {% cite Rathjen2006 %}
        (The set of cardinals $κ$ below $δ$ that are
        $\\mathcal{A}$-[shrewd](Shrewd "Shrewd")
        in $V\_δ$ is stationary.)
    -   there is an $η$-shrewd cardinal below $δ$ for all $η
        &lt; δ$. {% cite Rathjen2006 %}

## Ethereal cardinal

*To be expanded.*

## $n$-ineffable cardinal

The $n$-ineffable cardinals for $2\\leq n&lt;ω$ were introduced by
Baumgartner in {% cite Baumgartner1975 %} as a
strengthening of ineffable cardinals. A cardinal is $n$-ineffable if for
every function $F:\[κ\]^n\\rightarrow 2$ there is a stationary
$H\\subseteqκ$ such that $F\\upharpoonright \[H\]^n$ is constant.

-   $2$-ineffable cardinals are exactly the ineffable cardinals.
-   an $n+1$-ineffable cardinal is a stationary limit of $n$-ineffable
    cardinals. {% cite Baumgartner1975 %}

A cardinal $κ$ is totally ineffable if it is $n$-ineffable for
every $n$.

-   a $1$-iterable cardinal is a stationary limit of totally ineffable
    cardinals. (this follows from material in
    {% cite Gitman2011 %})

### Helix

(Information in this subsection come from
{% cite Friedman1998 %} unless noted otherwise.)

For $k \\geq 1$ we define:

-   $\\mathcal{P}(x)$ is the powerset (set of all subsets) of $x$.
    $\\mathcal{P}\_k(x)$ is the set of all subsets of $x$ with exactly
    $k$ elements.
-   $f:\\mathcal{P}\_k(λ) \\to \\mathcal{P}(λ)$ is
    regressive iff for all $A \\in \\mathcal{P}\_k(λ)$, we have
    $f(A) \\subseteq \\min(A)$.
-   $E$ is $f$-homogenous iff $E \\subseteq λ$ and for all $B,C
    \\in \\mathcal{P}\_k(E)$, we have $f(B) \\cap \\min(B \\cup C) =
    f(C) \\cap \\min(B \\cup C)$.
-   $λ$ is $k$-subtle iff $λ$ is a limit ordinal and for
    all clubs $C \\subseteq λ$ and regressive
    $f:\\mathcal{P}\_k(λ) \\to \\mathcal{P}(λ)$, there
    exists an $f$-homogenous $A \\in \\mathcal{P}\_{k+1}(C)$.
-   $λ$ is $k$-almost ineffable iff $λ$ is a limit ordinal
    and for all regressive $f:\\mathcal{P}\_k(λ) \\to
    \\mathcal{P}(λ)$, there exists an $f$-homogenous $A
    \\subseteq λ$ of cardinality $λ$.
-   $λ$ is $k$-ineffable iff $λ$ is a limit ordinal and
    for all regressive $f:\\mathcal{P}\_k(λ) \\to
    \\mathcal{P}(λ)$, there exists an $f$-homogenous stationary
    $A \\subseteq λ$.

$0$-subtle, $0$-almost ineffable and $0$-ineffable cardinals can be
defined as “uncountable regular cardinals” because for $k \\geq 1$ all
three properties imply being uncountable regular cardinals.

-   For $k \\geq 1$, if $κ$ is a $k$-ineffable cardinal, then
    $κ$ is $k$-almost ineffable and the set of $k$-almost
    ineffable cardinals is stationary in $κ$.
-   For $k \\geq 1$, if $κ$ is a $k$-almost ineffable cardinal,
    then $κ$ is $k$-subtle and the set of $k$-subtle cardinals is
    stationary in $κ$.
-   For $k \\geq 1$, if $κ$ is a $k$-subtle cardinal, then the set
    of $(k-1)$-ineffable cardinals is stationary in $κ$.
-   For $k \\geq n \\geq 0$, all $k$-ineffable cardinals are
    $n$-ineffable, all $k$-almost ineffable cardinals are $n$-almost
    ineffable and all $k$-subtle cardinals are $n$-subtle.

This structure is similar to the [double helix of $n$-fold
variants](N-fold_variants "N-fold variants")
and earlier known although
smaller. {% cite Kentaro2007 %}

## Completely ineffable cardinal

Completely ineffable cardinals were introduced in {% cite Abramson1977 %}
as a strengthening of ineffable cardinals. Define that a collection
$R\\subseteq P(κ)$ is a stationary class if

-   $R\\neq\\emptyset$,
-   for all $A\\in R$, $A$ is stationary in $κ$,
-   if $A\\in R$ and $B\\supseteq A$, then $B\\in R$.

A cardinal $κ$ is completely ineffable if there is a stationary
class $R$ such that for every $A\\in R$ and $F:\[A\]^2\\to2$, there is
$H\\in R$ such that $F\\upharpoonright \[H\]^2$ is constant.

    {% cite Abramson1977 %}
-   There are stationarily many completely ineffable, [greatly
    Erdős](Erdos "Erdos")
    cardinals below any

    cardinal. {% cite Sharpe2011 %}
-   The following are
    equivalent: {% cite Nielsen2018 %}
    -   $κ$ is completely ineffable.
    -   $κ$ is coherent $&lt;ω$-Ramsey.
    -   $κ$ has the $ω$-[filter property](Filter_property "Filter property")
-   Every completely ineffable is a stationary limit of
    $&lt;ω$-Ramseys. {% cite Nielsen2018 %}
-   Completely Ramsey cardinals and $ω$-Ramsey cardinals are completely
    ineffable. {% cite Nielsen2018 %}

    cardinals.{% cite Holy2018 %}
