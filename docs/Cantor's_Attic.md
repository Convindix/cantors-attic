Climb into Cantor's Attic, where you will find infinities large and
small. We aim to provide a comprehensive resource of information about
all notions of mathematical infinity. Our site is organized into several
large categories:

[The upper attic](/Upper_attic "Upper attic")   
The upper attic is the realm of large cardinals and the higher infinite,
extending from inaccessibility to inconsistency.

[The middle attic](/Middle_attic "Middle attic")   
The middle attic surveys the infinite cardinals whose existence can be
proved in, or is at least equiconsistent with, the ZFC axioms of set
theory.

[The lower attic](/Lower_attic "Lower attic")   
The lower attic classifies various large countable ordinals.


[The parlour](/Parlour "Parlour")   
Aspiring to the attic, the parlour contains the truly vast finite
numbers.


[The playroom](/Playroom "Playroom")   
Enjoy the stimulating entertainments of the playroom, full of fun and
paradox.

[The library](/Library "Library")   
Peruse the selections of our library, the central repository of all
references cited here at Cantor's attic.

[The cellar](/Cellar "Cellar")   
Review the foundations of our subject with informative background
presentations of ideas used throughout the attic.
