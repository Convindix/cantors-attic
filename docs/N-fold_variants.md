*This page is a WIP.* The \$n\$-fold variants of large cardinal axioms
were created by Sato Kentaro in \[[1](#bibkey_Kentaro2007:DoubleHelix)\]
in order to study and investigate the double helix phenomena. The double

such cardinals, which can be seen below.

[\$n\$-fold Variants]{#.24n.24-fold_Variants .mw-headline}
----------------------------------------------------------

The \$n\$-fold variants of large cardinals were given in a very large
paper by Sato Kentaro. Most of the definitions involve giving large
closure properties to the \$M\$ used in the original large cardinal in
an [elementary
embedding](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
\$j:V\\rightarrow M\$. They are very large, but
[rank-into-rank](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Rank_into_rank "Rank into rank")
cardinals are stronger than most \$n\$-fold variants of large cardinals.

Generally, the \$n\$-fold variant of a large cardinal axiom is the
similar to the generalization of
[superstrong](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Superstrong "Superstrong")
cardinals to
[\$n\$-superstrong](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Superstrong "Superstrong")
cardinals,
[huge](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Huge "Huge")
cardinals to
[\$n\$-huge](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Huge "Huge")
cardinals, etc. More specifically, if the definition of the original
axiom is that \$j:V\\prec M\$ has critical point \$\\kappa\$ and \$M\$
has some closure property which uses \$\\kappa\$, then the definition of
the \$n\$-fold variant of the axiom is that \$M\$ has that closure
property on \$j\^n{\\kappa}\$.

### [\$n\$-fold Variants Which Are Simply the Original Large Cardinal]{#.24n.24-fold_Variants_Which_Are_Simply_the_Original_Large_Cardinal .mw-headline}

There were many \$n\$-fold variants which were simply different names of
the original large cardinal. This was due to the fact that some n-fold
variants, if only named n-variants instead, would be confusing to the
reader (for example the \$n\$-fold extendibles rather than the
[\$n\$-extendibles](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Extendible "Extendible")).
Here are a list of such cardinals:

-   The **\$n\$-fold superstrong** cardinals are precisely the
    [\$n\$-superstrong](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Superstrong "Superstrong")
    cardinals
-   The **\$n\$-fold almost huge** cardinals are precisely the [almost
    \$n\$-huge](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Huge "Huge")
    cardinals
-   The **\$n\$-fold huge** cardinals are precisely the
    [\$n\$-huge](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Huge "Huge")
    cardinals
-   The **\$n\$-fold superhuge** cardinals are precisely the
    [\$n\$-superhuge](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Huge "Huge")
    cardinals
-   The **\$\\omega\$-fold superstrong** and **\$\\omega\$-fold Shelah**
    cardinals are precisely the
    [I2](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Rank-into-rank "Rank-into-rank"){.mw-redirect}
    cardinals

### [\$n\$-fold supercompact cardinals]{#.24n.24-fold_supercompact_cardinals .mw-headline}

A cardinal \$\\kappa\$ is **\$n\$-fold \$\\lambda\$-supercompact** iff
it is the critical point of some nontrivial elementary embedding
\$j:V\\rightarrow M\$ such that \$\\lambda&lt;j(\\kappa)\$ and
\$M\^{j\^{n-1}(\\lambda)}\\subset M\$ (i.e. \$M\$ is closed under all of
its sequences of length \$j\^{n-1}(\\lambda)\$). This definition is very
similar to that of the
[\$n\$-huge](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Huge "Huge")
cardinals.

A cardinal \$\\kappa\$ is **\$n\$-fold supercompact** iff it is
\$n\$-fold \$\\lambda\$-supercompact for every \$\\lambda\$.
Consistency-wise, the \$n\$-fold supercompact cardinals are stronger
than the
[\$n\$-superstrong](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Superstrong "Superstrong")
cardinals and weaker than the \$(n+1)\$-fold strong cardinals. In fact,
if an \$n\$-fold supercompact cardinal exists, then it is consistent for
there to be a proper class of \$n\$-superstrong cardinals.

It is clear that the \$n+1\$-fold \$0\$-supercompact cardinals are
precisely the
[\$n\$-huge](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Huge "Huge")
cardinals. The \$1\$-fold supercompact cardinals are precisely the
[supercompact](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Supercompact "Supercompact")
cardinals. The \$0\$-fold supercompact cardinals are precisely the
[measurable](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Measurable "Measurable")
cardinals.

### [\$n\$-fold strong cardinals]{#.24n.24-fold_strong_cardinals .mw-headline}

A cardinal \$\\kappa\$ is **\$n\$-fold \$\\lambda\$-strong** iff it is
the critical point of some nontrivial elementary embedding
\$j:V\\rightarrow M\$ such that \$\\kappa+\\lambda&lt;j(\\kappa)\$ and
\$V\_{j\^{n-1}(\\kappa+\\lambda)}\\subset M\$.

A cardinal \$\\kappa\$ is **\$n\$-fold strong** iff it is \$n\$-fold
\$\\lambda\$-strong for every \$\\lambda\$. Consistency-wise, the
\$(n+1)\$-fold strong cardinals are stronger than the \$n\$-fold
supercompact cardinals, equivalent to the \$n\$-fold extendible
cardinals, and weaker than the \$(n+1)\$-fold Woodin cardinals. More
specifically, in the rank of an (n+1)-fold Woodin cardinal there is an
\$(n+1)\$-fold strong cardinal.

It is clear that the \$(n+1)\$-fold \$0\$-strong cardinals are precisely
the
[\$n\$-superstrong](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Superstrong "Superstrong")
cardinals. The \$1\$-fold strong cardinals are precisely the
[strong](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Strong "Strong")
cardinals. The \$0\$-fold strong cardinals are precisely the
[measurable](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Measurable "Measurable")
cardinals.

### [\$n\$-fold extendible cardinals]{#.24n.24-fold_extendible_cardinals .mw-headline}

For ordinal \$η\$, class \$F\$, positive natural \$n\$ and
\$κ+η&lt;κ\_1&lt;···&lt;κ\_n\$:

-   Cardinal \$κ\$ is **\$n\$-fold \$η\$-extendible for \$F\$** with
    targets \$κ\_1,...,κ\_n\$ iff there are
    \$κ+η=ζ\_0&lt;ζ\_1&lt;···&lt;ζ\_n\$ and an iteration sequence
    \$\\vec e\$ through \$〈(V\_{ζ\_i},F∩V\_{ζ\_i})|i≤n〉\$ with
    \$\\mathrm{crit}(\\vec e)=κ\$, and \$e\_{0,i}(κ)=κ\_i\$.
-   Cardinal \$κ\$ is **\$n\$-fold extendible for \$F\$** iff, for every
    \$η\$, \$κ\$ is \$n\$-fold \$η\$-extendible for \$F\$.
-   Cardinal \$κ\$ is **\$n\$-fold extendible** iff it is \$n\$-fold
    extendible for \$\\varnothing\$.

\$n\$-fold extendible cardinals are precisely \$n+1\$ strong cardinals.

\$n\$-fold \$1\$-extendibility is implied by \$(n+1)\$-fold
\$1\$-strongness and implies \$n\$-fold superstrongness.

### [\$n\$-fold Woodin cardinals]{#.24n.24-fold_Woodin_cardinals .mw-headline}

A cardinal \$\\kappa\$ is **\$n\$-fold Woodin** iff for every function
\$f:\\kappa\\rightarrow\\kappa\$ there is some ordinal
\$\\alpha&lt;\\kappa\$ such that
\$\\{f(\\beta):\\beta&lt;\\alpha\\}\\subseteq\\alpha\$ and
\$V\_{j\^{n}(f)(j\^{n-1}(\\alpha))}\\subset M\$. Consistency-wise, the
\$(n+1)\$-fold Woodin cardinals are stronger than the \$(n+1)\$-fold
strong cardinals, and weaker than the \$(n+1)\$-fold Shelah cardinals.
Specifically, in the rank of an \$(n+1)\$-fold Shelah cardinal there is
an \$(n+1)\$-fold Woodin cardinal, and every \$(n+1)\$-fold Shelah
cardinal is also an \$(n+1)\$-fold Woodin cardinal.

The \$2\$-fold Woodin cardinals are precisely the
[Vopěnka](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Vopenka "Vopenka")
cardinals (therefore precisely the [Woodin for
supercompactness](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Woodin#Shelah "Woodin")
cardinals). In fact, the \$n+1\$-fold Woodin cardinals are precisely the
\$n\$-fold Vopěnka cardinals. The \$1\$-fold Woodin cardinals are
precisely the
[Woodin](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Woodin "Woodin")
cardinals.

*(More to be added)*

[\$\\omega\$-fold variants]{#.24.5Comega.24-fold_variants .mw-headline}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The \$\\omega\$-fold variant is a very strong version of the \$n\$-fold
variant, to the point where they even beat some of the
[rank-into-rank](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Rank-into-rank "Rank-into-rank"){.mw-redirect}
axioms in consistency strength. Interestingly, they follow a somewhat
backwards pattern of consistency strength relative to the original
double helix. For example, \$n\$-fold strong is much weaker than
\$n\$-fold Vopěnka (the jump is similar to the jump between a
[strong](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Strong "Strong")
cardinal and a
[Vopěnka](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Vopenka "Vopenka")
cardinal), but \$\\omega\$-fold strong is much, much stronger than
\$\\omega\$-fold Vopěnka.

### [\$\\omega\$-fold extendible]{#.24.5Comega.24-fold_extendible .mw-headline}

For ordinal \$η\$ and class \$F\$:

-   Cardinal \$κ\$ is **\$ω\$-fold \$η\$-extendible for \$F\$** iff
    there are \$κ+η=ζ\_0&lt;ζ\_1&lt;ζ\_2&lt;...\$ and an iteration
    sequence \$\\vec e\$ through \$〈(V\_{ζ\_i},F∩V\_{ζ\_i})|i∈ω〉\$
    with \$\\mathrm{crit}(\\vec e)=κ\$, and \$e\^{(1)}(κ)&gt;κ+η\$.
-   Cardinal \$κ\$ is **\$ω\$-fold extendible for \$F\$** iff, for every
    \$η\$, \$κ\$ is \$ω\$-fold \$η\$-extendible for \$F\$.
-   Cardinal \$κ\$ is **\$ω\$-fold extendible** iff it is \$ω\$-fold
    extendible for \$\\varnothing\$.

Results:

-   An \$ω\$-fold extendible cardinal \$κ\$ is the \$κ\$-th element of
    the class of the critical points of all witnesses of I3.
-   If \$κ\$ is a regular cardinal and \$F⊂V\_κ\$, we
    have\$\\{α&lt;κ|(V\_κ,F)\\models \\text{“\$α\$ is \$ω\$-fold
    extendible for \$F\$”}\\}∈F\^{(ω)}\_{Vop,κ}\$.
-   If there is an \$ω\$-fold Vopěnka cardinal, then the existence of a
    proper class of \$ω\$-fold extendible cardinals is consistent.

### [\$\\omega\$-fold Vopěnka]{#.24.5Comega.24-fold_Vop.C4.9Bnka .mw-headline}

Definition:

-   A **set \$X\$** is **\$ω\$-fold Vopěnka** for a cardinal \$κ\$ iff,
    for every \$κ\$-natural sequence \$〈\\mathcal{M}\_α|α&lt;κ〉\$,
    there are an increasing sequence \$〈α\_n|n∈ω〉\$ with \$α\_n&lt;κ\$
    and an iteration sequence \$\\vec e\$ through
    \$〈\\mathcal{M}\_{α\_n}|n∈ω〉\$ such that \$\\mathrm{crit}(\\vec
    e)∈X\$ .
-   A **cardinal** \$κ\$ is **\$ω\$-fold Vopěnka** iff \$κ\$ is regular
    and \$κ\$ is \$ω\$-fold Vopěnka for \$κ\$.
-   \$F\^{(ω)}\_{Vop,κ}=\\{X∈\\mathcal{P}(κ)|\\text{κ \\\\ X is not
    \$ω\$-fold Vopěnka for \$κ\$}\\}\$.

Results:

-   An \$ω\$-fold superstrong cardinal is the \$κ\$-th \$ω\$-fold
    Vopěnka cardinal.
-   The critical point \$κ\$ of a witness of \$IE\^ω\$ is the \$κ\$-th
    \$ω\$-fold Vopěnka cardinal.

### [\$\\omega\$-fold Woodin]{#.24.5Comega.24-fold_Woodin .mw-headline}

A cardinal \$\\kappa\$ is **\$\\omega\$-fold Woodin** iff for every
function \$f:\\kappa\\rightarrow\\kappa\$ there is some ordinal
\$\\alpha&lt;\\kappa\$ such that
\$\\{f(\\beta):\\beta&lt;\\alpha\\}\\subseteq\\alpha\$ and
\$V\_{j\^{\\omega}(f)(\\alpha))}\\subset M\$.

Consistency-wise, the existence of an \$\\omega\$-fold Woodin cardinal
is stronger than the
[I2](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Rank-into-rank "Rank-into-rank"){.mw-redirect}
axiom, but weaker than the existence of an \$\\omega\$-fold strong
cardinal. In particular, if there is an \$\\omega\$-fold strong cardinal
\$\\kappa\$ then \$\\kappa\$ is \$\\omega\$-fold Woodin and has
\$\\kappa\$-many \$\\omega\$-fold Woodin cardinals below it, and
\$V\_\\kappa\$ satisfies the existence of a proper class of
\$\\omega\$-fold Woodin cardinals.

### [\$\\omega\$-fold strong]{#.24.5Comega.24-fold_strong .mw-headline}

A cardinal \$\\kappa\$ is **\$\\omega\$-fold \$\\lambda\$-strong** iff
it is the critical point of some nontrivial elementary embedding
\$j:V\\rightarrow M\$ such that \$\\kappa+\\lambda&lt;j(\\kappa)\$ and
\$V\_{j\^\\omega(\\kappa+\\lambda)}\\subset M\$.

\$\\kappa\$ is **\$\\omega\$-fold strong** iff it is \$\\omega\$-fold
\$\\lambda\$-strong for every \$\\lambda\$.

Consistency-wise, the existence of an \$\\omega\$-fold strong cardinal
is stronger than the existence of an \$\\omega\$-fold Woodin cardinal
and weaker than the assertion that there is a
\$\\Sigma\_4\^1\$-elementary embedding \$j:V\_\\lambda\\prec
V\_\\lambda\$ with an uncountable critical point \$\\kappa&lt;\\lambda\$
(this is a weakening of the
[I1](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Rank-into-rank "Rank-into-rank"){.mw-redirect}
axiom known as \$E\_2\$). In particular, if there is a cardinal
\$\\kappa\$ which is the critical point of some elementary embedding
witnessing the \$E\_2\$ axiom, then there is a nonprincipal
\$\\kappa\$-complete
[ultrafilter](/web/20191005075330/http://cantorsattic.info/Filter "Filter")
over \$\\kappa\$ which contains the set of all cardinals which are
\$\\omega\$-fold strong in \$V\_\\kappa\$ and therefore \$V\_\\kappa\$
satisfies the existence of a proper class of \$\\omega\$-fold strong
cardinals.
