An order isomorphism is a particular type of isomorphism that preserves
order.

We say that $f$ creates an isomorphism between two relational systems $(
A , &lt;\_A )$ and $( B , &lt;\_B )$ if and only if $f$ creates a
bijection between $A$ and $B$ and for all $x$ and $y$ in $A$, $x &lt;\_A
y \\leftrightarrow f(x) &lt;\_B f(y)$

## Properties

Order-isomorphisms preserve ordering, so if $( A , &lt;\_A )$ is
strictly ordered, founded, or well-ordered, then $( B , &lt;\_B )$ will
be as well.

All well-ordered sets are isomorphic to a unique
[ordinal](Ordinal "Ordinal").
If two ordinals are order-isomorphic with respect to membership, then
they are equal. Between two well-ordered sets $A$ and $B$, exactly 1 of
the following will hold:

-   $A$ is order-isomorphic to $B$
-   $A$ is order-isomorphic to an initial segment of $B$
-   An initial segment of $A$ is order-isomorphic to $B$
