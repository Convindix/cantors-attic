# Continuum











  
The *continuum* is the cardinality of the reals $\\mathbb{R}$, and is
variously denoted $\\frak{c}$, $2^{\\aleph\_0}$, $\|\\mathbb{R}\|$,
$\\beth\_1$, $2^\\omega$.

## Continuum hypothesis

The *continuum hypothesis* is the assertion that the continuum is the
same as the first uncountable cardinal
<a href="Aleph_one" class="mw-redirect" title="Aleph one">$\aleph_1$</a>.
The *generalized continuum hypothesis* is the assertion that for any
infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, the power set $P(\\kappa)$ has the same
cardinality as the
<a href="Successor" class="mw-redirect" title="Successor">successor</a>
cardinal $\\kappa^+$. This is equivalent, by transfinite induction, to
the assertion that $\\aleph\_\\alpha=\\beth\_\\alpha$ for every ordinal
$\\alpha$.
