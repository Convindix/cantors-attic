A successor ordinal, by definition, is an ordinal $α$ that is
equal to $β + 1$ for some ordinal $β$.

The successor function, denoted as $β+1$, $\\operatorname{suc}
β$, or $β ^+$ is defined on the ordinals as $β \\cup \\{
β \\}$

## Properties of the successor

There are no ordinals between $β$ and $β + 1$.

The union $\\bigcup β$ can be thought of as an inverse successor
function, because $\\bigcup ( β + 1 ) = β$. All [limit
ordinals](Limit_ordinal "Limit ordinal")
are equal to their union.
