# The axiom of constructibility, $V = L$






(Redirected from [V =
L](/index.php?title=V_%3D_L&redirect=no "V = L"))






  
The axiom of constructibility, written $V=L$, is the assertion that the
universe of all sets is exactly the universe of all constructible sets.
It is minimalistic in the sense that any inner model $M$ of ZF must
contain all sets from GÃ¶del's constructible universe $L$. The axiom is
compatible with some of the smaller large cardinal notions such as weak
compactness but is *not* compatible with any large cardinal notion
implying the existence of
[$0^{\\sharp}$](/Zero_sharp "Zero sharp")
such as measurability.
