# Hartog number











The **Hartog number** of a set $X$ is the least
[ordinal](/Ordinal "Ordinal")
which cannot be mapped injectively into $X$. For well-ordered sets $X$
the Hartog number is exactly $\|X\|^+$, the [successor
cardinal](/Cardinal#Successor_cardinals "Cardinal")
of $\|X\|$.

When assuming the negation of the
<a href="/Axiom_of_Choice" class="mw-redirect" title="Axiom of Choice">axiom of choice</a>
some sets cannot be well-ordered, and the Hartog number measures how
well-ordered they can be.

## Properties

-   $X$ can be well ordered if and only if $\|X\|$ is comparable with
    its Hartog number.
-   There *can* be a surjection from $X$ onto its Hartog number.
