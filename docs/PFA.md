A cardinal $κ$ is a *PFA cardinal* if $κ$ is not zero and
the canonical forcing of the PFA of length $κ$, which is the
countable support iteration that at each stage $\\gamma$ forces with the
lottery sum of all minimal-rank proper partial orders $\\mathbb{Q}$ for
which there is a family $\\cal{D}$ of $ω\_1$ many dense sets in
$\\mathbb{Q}$ for which there is no filter in $\\mathbb{Q}$ meeting
them, forces PFA.

Every supercompact cardinal is a PFA cardinal. It is not yet clear
whether the converse is true.

Viale and Weiß have shown that an inaccessible PFA cardinal $κ$
for which the canonical forcing of the PFA makes $κ$ become
$ω\_2$ is
supercompact. {% cite Viale2011 %}
