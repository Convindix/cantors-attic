## Welcome to the static Cantor's Attic

The original site hosted at cantorsattic.info is broken and anyways needs a running server with databases and PHP.

This is a proposal to have the same content hosted as static pages, moving both contribution and discussion to
github (pull requests and reviews, possibly wiki etc)

The pages are in Markdown, I will work to support mathjax and all the rest of niceties.

Contributions are welcome!
